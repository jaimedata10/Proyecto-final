      <h3 class="secondTitle lineNews">Overall verdict </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        "It may look like a SEAT Ateca with a different badge, but it is actually the start of something new. The
        Spanish carmaker has launched its top-performance sub-brand, Cupra, as an entity in its own right."
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        The first car to be launched under the Cupra name is the Ateca. It is basically a SEAT Ateca with a 300 hp
        2.0-litre petrol engine from the Volkswagen Golf R that includes racing wings, diffusers and quad exhaust pipes.
        If you're looking for a family crossover SUV with loads of attitude, this is the one for you.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        We could say that the Cupra Ateca is a barking dog, but also a biter. With four-wheel drive and a standard DSG
        automatic transmission, the Cupra Ateca reaches 100 km/h in just 4.9 seconds, as fast as a true compact sports
        car like the aforementioned Golf R.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        It is, without a doubt, an excellent motorway companion and with a lot of standard technology which translates
        into a pleasant experience when driving and especially when moving and parking around the city.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        Although the interior is not as elegant as that of the BMW X2 M35i, it is clearly well designed. The standard
        touchscreen infotainment and multimedia system and digital dials make the Cupra Ateca look modern, while sporty
        touches such as velvet-look seats and bright aluminum pedals give it a sporty touch.
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle lineNews">Is it suitable for you?</h3>

      <div class="imageNews1">
        <img src="photosNews/news1/New-CUPRA-ateca2.jpg" alt="" class="carPics">
      </div>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        If you want a utility, but also want the practicality of a family crossover SUV, the Cupra Ateca is your choice.
        It's not as exciting to drive as its rivals, but it still corners very well and has incredible speed.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        It is also very versatile: not only does it have room for the whole family, but it is also very good for
        covering long distances in comfort. The Ateca's biggest problem is its consumption: it's going to hurt to reach
        50 km/h unless you drive very sensibly.
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle lineNews">Similar cars</h3>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        Although there are some attractive crossovers on the market, there is nothing like the Cupra Ateca. The
        Volkswagen T-Roc R is probably the closest rival, sharing the same platform and engine, although it's a bit
        smaller and not as practical.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        The Audi SQ2, which is also smaller than the Ateca, is Audi's version of a crossover, while BMW offers the X2
        M35i. You can also consider other options like the Skoda Octavia vRS or the Volkswagen Golf R, which are also
        sold as station wagons.
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle lineNews">Safety equipment</h3>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        If you are going to take your family in a car as fast as the Cupra Ateca, you are going to want it to have all
        the security systems. Fortunately, Seat is not going to disappoint us.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        The front assistance system that uses a radar to control the cars that go in front of us stands out. If it
        detects a potential collision, it will alert the driver and may even brake on its own to reduce the impact. With
        the city emergency braking system, the car will come to a complete stop to avoid a collision with stopped
        traffic.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        It also has a fatigue recognition system that monitors things like erratic steering movements and lane
        departures, after which it will prompt the driver to take a break if it suspects one is needed.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        Other very useful safety features are the hill hold control system, which holds the car for two seconds after
        the brake pedal is lifted, to avoid unnecessary collisions with other cars.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        We can include a spare wheel and this can be fitted to used models, as long as we don't have the Comfort and
        Sound and Design packages, which will cover that space.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        When the standard SEAT Ateca underwent Euro NCAP crash tests in 2016, it received an impressive five-star safety
        rating. It performed particularly well in tests for both adult and child occupants, scoring 93% and 84%
        respectively.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        SEAT's pedestrian protection features, including deformable front fenders and space between the bonnet and
        engine, contribute to a 71% pedestrian safety rating. The Ateca obtained 60% in terms of its safety assistance
        functions, losing points for not having a standard lane assist system (which the Cupra Ateca does have).
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle lineNews">Consumption and costs</h3>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        "In WLTP fuel economy tests (which are usually quite representative of real-world conditions), the Cupra Ateca
        performs between 11.22 and 11.50 km/l."
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        That's a pretty realistic figure, in our experience, as long as you're gentle on the throttle and resist the
        urge to use sport mode. If you take advantage of its full potential, 7 km/l may be more realistic...
