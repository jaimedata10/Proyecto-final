      <h3 class="secondTitle lineNews">Overall verdict</h3>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        â€œThe Q7 is a perfect example of what can be achieved with attention to detail. Great things can be achieved when
        no effort is spared.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        There is not a single area in which Audi's large seven-seater SUV does not perform masterfully. This makes it
        the most versatile car in the class and, in fact, the best car of its kind.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        First of all, it is an ideal car for the family. It is one of the most spacious cars in its group, with plenty
        of space between each of its seven seats and with many different possibilities when it comes to structuring the
        seats and the boot, so it is also incredibly versatile. Those inside will also feel cared for thanks to the
        incredible quality of the cabin and generous luxury equipment.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        It is also important to mention that it is an ideal car for the family due to its driving. The Q7 maintains
        comfort and peace of mind on all types of journeys, keeping every journey a relaxed and calm environment.
        Despite being surprisingly comfortable, it is also very agile in the corners, keeping passengers safe and
        driving fun. A little warning: the best Q7s have air suspension. If you are going to buy a car, check that it
        has air suspension, because you are going to want it without a doubt.
      </p>

      <div class="imageNews1">
        <img class="carPics" src="photosNews/news1/Audi_Q7__3_.jpg" alt="">
      </div>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        On the other hand, the engines offer an impressive mix of performance, fuel economy and refinement, and judging
        by the amount of safety equipment and the five-star Euro NCAP rating, your family will be in good hands. Any
        complaints? Granted, the touchscreen system on the post-facelift cars was a bit awkward and distracting, and the
        automatic gearbox could be more responsive, but other than that, we can't really complain about much else.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        When it first came out in 2015, it was criticized by many in the automotive press for being boring and lacking
        in character. We disagree, but everyone is entitled to have an opinion. Besides, who needs character when you
        excel at everything else? Just look at David Beckham, please...
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle lineNews">Is it suitable for you?</h3>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        Ask yourself the following: do I want the best seven-seater SUV that exists? Of course. And why not? If that's
        the case, then the Audi Q7 is for you. It is not the largest car in its group, nor the cheapest, nor the most
        practical, nor the most ergonomic. However, in the areas where it doesn't stand out from its pack (there are
        plenty of others where it does anyway), it's still right up there with cars that do stand out. This makes the Q7
        an incredibly versatile car that will fit right into the routine of any affluent family, making it easier, more
        relaxing, more comfortable, more entertaining and instantly more sophisticated.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        Of course, if you're looking for a seven-seat luxury off-roader rather than an SUV, you'll be better off with
        the Land Rover Discovery, as it's more rugged. However, if you're like most SUV buyers and never go farther than
        the parking lot of your neighborhood greengrocer, the Q7 will be the perfect family car.
      </p>

      <div class="imageNews1">
        <img class="carPics" src="photosNews/news1/Audi_Q7__4_.jpg" alt="">
      </div>

      <h3 class="secondTitle lineNews">Similar cars</h3>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        Since it's a large, luxurious seven-seat SUV, the Q7's clearest rivals are the Volvo XC90 and Land Rover
        Discovery. Obviously, you can't talk about an Audi offering without mentioning either a BMW or a Mercedes, and
        while the BMW X5 and Mercedes GLE come standard with five seats, both cars are also offered with seven seats.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-margin-news">
        If you go up in both size and price, the BMW X7 and Mercedes GLS from the same houses could also be considered.
        The Lexus RX-L would also compete for your money, while more affordable alternatives include the Peugeot 5008,
        Skoda Kodiaq, and Volkswagen Tiguan Allspace.
