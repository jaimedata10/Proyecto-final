      <h3 class="titleNews">Five tips for traveling at christmas</h3>
      <div class="imageNews1">
        <img class="carPics" src="photosNews/news1/navidad.jpg" alt="">
      </div>

      <p>
        03.11.2021 - The Christmas dates are approaching, and with them, the almost 20 million long-distance trips that
        are expected each year —in three phases: Christmas, New Year's Eve and Kings— by the General Directorate of
        Traffic. It is always important to remember that the main thing in these cases is to arrive to spend a memorable
        time with your loved ones, and that 85% of fatal accidents occur on intercity roads.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this reason, and to guarantee the greatest possible safety during the winter months, we have decided to
        compile some safety tips that you should review before setting off, no matter where you are going.
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle">1. Wheels</h3>

      <p>
        Tires are the most important safety element of any vehicle, since they are the only point of contact that it has
        with the road, and braking time, acceleration and grip in low traction situations depend on them. According to
        the national association of tire manufacturers, Afane, price is one of the decisive factors when choosing
        between one product or another, and in the case of wheels, where it can vary a lot and the differences are not
        so obvious, it is even more so.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this reason, it is essential to check the correct pressure of them, as well as their state of wear,
        observing if the tread measures less than 2 millimeters —the legal limit is 1.6mm but we recommend changing them
        much earlier—, at which time it is important to change them.
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle">2. Fluids</h3>

      <p>
        To ensure the longevity of your car, it's essential that you keep your fluid levels in check, but we know it's
        not always easy to remember. Of course, the most important of them —and the one that is checked the least— is
        the oil, since a poorly lubricated engine is a poorly cooled engine and can seize, which practically turn the
        propellant into a huge paperweight and are one of the repairs masks.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, overheating is not one of the main problems in low temperatures, as freezing can be. For this reason,
        another essential fluid for your car in winter is the antifreeze in the radiator, which will allow it to
        continue cooling this fundamental component and allow your engine to operate at its optimum temperature
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle">3. Battery</h3>

      <p>
        Despite the fact that electric vehicles are now the great novelty on the market and their batteries are a
        component that will largely determine their value, it is important not to underestimate their role in thermal
        engines. This element is one of the most affected by low temperatures, so it should be checked.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your car with the engine off has dim lights or if it is difficult to start on cold mornings, these can be two
        of the most frequent symptoms of battery failure. It is important to check its charge and voltage —after a time
        of rest, with a multimeter it should not be less than 12.6 volts—, to prevent it from causing problems in other
        more expensive elements of the vehicle, such as the alternator and to make sure that, when you start your trip,
        your car starts the first time.
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle">4. Lights</h3>

      <p>
        The days in winter are considerably shorter. The sun rises later and the sun sets earlier, so having your lights
        in good working order is not only essential for safety reasons, to see the road better and for other drivers to
        detect you earlier —it is essential to have them properly adjusted to avoid glare—, but also to ensure less
        visual fatigue on your trips when there is no sun. In any case, our recommendation will always be that you drive
        during the day, to avoid drowsiness.
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle">5. If you drink, don't drive</h3>

      <p>
        We are surprised that, in 2021, we have to keep remembering this, but Christmas dates are days when company
        dinners, meetings with friends and family get-togethers abound. And in all of them, alcohol consumption is
        frequent —in Spain, 13% of people say they drink it every day, making us the second country to do so in Europe—
        and the accident statistics do not lie: 45.5% of those who died on the road had tested positive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alcohol on the road induces and increases several risk factors: it increases reaction time, decreases the
        perception of safety, increases drowsiness, disinhibition and also distractions behind the wheel. We know you
        know, and we don't want to repeat it: please don't drive under the influence of drugs.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are just some of the elements to take into account before your Christmas trips and ensure that they take
        place with all the safety that you and your family deserve. Another factor to consider is that Spain is the
        second country in Europe with the oldest vehicle fleet, reaching an average age of 13 years. These, by
        themselves, are less safe than modern versions, as well as more polluting.
      </p>


      <p>
        For this reason, if you want to contribute to modernizing the fleet and renewing your car for a much safer one,
        which has all the technology of driving assistance systems, you can find many vehicles that fit your needs on
        our portal, where everyone has maximum eight years old and 150,000 kilometers.
