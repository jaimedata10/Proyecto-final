      <h3 class="titleNews">The importance of Formula E for the future of the automotive industry</h3>

      <div class="imageNews1">
        <img class="carPics" src="photosNews/news1/formula1.png" alt="">
      </div>


      <p>
        05.04.2022 - The first Formula E race was held in 2012. Many had long imagined that, sooner rather than later,
        the hegemony of internal combustion cars would come to an end, opening the way to other types of technologies
        alternatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        A year earlier, the F1 commission was already talking about organizing electric car races, only they had not yet
        named them.
      </p>

      <p>
        And so the dream was born for the future of having great international competition tournaments at the highest
        level with electric cars, and not with gasoline cars. Little by little, Formula E is beginning to be talked
        about as a counterpoint to Formula 1 petrol, which has always been considered the highest category of all motor
        competitions.
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle">¿La alternativa eléctrica de la Fórmula 1?</h3>

      <p>
        Formula 1 was created as a world championship for drivers and teams, with events called Grand Prix, held in
        different countries. It is the competition itself that spends the most money on drivers and especially on
        technology and new developments in the cars so that each team of drivers builds the fastest, most competitive
        and most reliable car.
      </p>

      <p>
        Formula 1 has always been a research laboratory for the highest automotive technology in materials, aerodynamic
        engines, tires, etc. Similarly, it is also a showcase for brands looking to create the most complete cars. And,
        of course, on many occasions Formula 1 races are the motivation and the fuel to feed the passion and love for
        racing cars and the engine.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that idea, people began to dream of an electric Formula 1. The FIA, the International Automobile
        Federation, which also controls Formula 1, saw it and was encouraged to create this championship. It's no wonder
        that he still doesn't have the renown of his older sister, as it's not always easy to win over a new
        competition.
      </p>

      <p>
        For quite some time, the electric car concept was exclusively associated with a slow, clumsy and unpleasant
        vehicle, and many people still believe that it is not a useful and viable option for consumers, nor the vehicle
        that could replace gasoline cars. in the next years.
      </p>

      <p>
        So these are two main objectives that Formula E pursues:
      </p>

      <p>
        ★ First of all, to let everyone know that electric vehicles already exist, that they are serious and that they
        are as valid as any other car to compete with them (although for now they still have some limitations).
      </p>

      <p>
        ★ At the same time, it serves as a laboratory to develop and apply the latest technologies in electric vehicle
        propulsion, such as new motors, batteries or charging systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, like any competition that starts from scratch, Formula E had to look for manufacturers, engineers, brands
        and suppliers who wanted to participate in its project.

      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, there is one thing to keep in mind: the grand championship title held by Formula 1, which has all the
        spectacle and celebrity associated with it, is still not in dispute. It is evident that Formula E is even more
        modest and humble.

      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle">What are Formula E cars like?</h3>

      <p>
        When it comes to the single-seaters that make up the new Formula E grid, we're talking about cars that have been
        designed to be competitive, while being as sustainable and efficient as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, there are only two types of tires for the entire championship. They must be durable, effective and
        efficient, while also being suitable for both dry and wet asphalt.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the ten races in the championship, each car will run on just five sets of tyres, meaning each set of tires
        must last two full Grands Prix, including practice, qualifying and the race itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Formula 1 racing it's not just about speed, it's also about strategy. These are races in which it will not be
        possible to reach speeds as fast as the 360 ​​km/h of Formula 1, but in which it will be necessary for the
        driver to show his talent and ability by taking advantage of the gaps that appear to overtake.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cars have a maximum power output of 200 kW (272 hp), which enables them to reach a top speed of 220 km/h and
        accelerate to 100 km/h in 3 seconds, using a five-speed sequential transmission.
      </p>

      <p>
        This maximum power can actually be used in training and racing, but not during the actual race. With a total
        power of 300 kW (400 hp).
      </p>

      <p>
        But with the new fanboost mode, usable power is increased by 30 kW (41 hp) for a limited time of five seconds
        per stroke. A curious thing about the fanboost is that it can only be used by the three drivers who were voted
        by their fans before the race. This measure is intended to make the competition more attractive to new
        followers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Formula E racing car weighs at least 888 kilograms including driver and is almost five meters long, 1.8
        meters wide and 1.25 meters high. The battery has a usable capacity of 28 kWh.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the cars that will compete for the ten teams in the first season will be the same. Simply, they will be
        personalized with the colors, logos and sponsors of the teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the second season we expect to see new developments and increasingly powerful features. Each team will be
        able to experiment with different changes and developments of their own, in the style of Formula 1, where the
        skill and dexterity of the engineers will make certain cars more competitive than others.
      </p>
