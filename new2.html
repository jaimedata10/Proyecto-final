      <div class="imageNews1">

      </div>

      <p>
        05.07.2021 — So you are looking for a family car?
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're still resisting the SUV trend, or if you've realized the lack of maneuverability and overwhelming fuel
        consumption of SUVs and prefer something more practical without giving up the space you've grown accustomed to,
        we don't blame you.
      </p>

      <p>
        A year earlier, the F1 commission was already talking about organizing electric car races, only they had not yet
        named them.
      </p>

      <p>
        The family silhouette, also known as a sports tourer or station wagon, has origins that go back even before the
        combustion engine. This last denomination, literally “station cart”, was a type of horse-drawn cart that was
        used to take travelers from their train stop to their lodging, including suitcases. The cargo space, spacious
        and protected against inclement weather, ensured that they arrived at their destination surrounded by luxury and
        comfort.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today there may no longer be the need to transport travelers and suitcases to the train station —at least not as
        much as before!—, but the essence remains the same and practicality triumphs. Station wagon silhouettes are
        Germany's favorite saloon type, and for good reason. Do you travel to the snow and do not know what to do with
        the skis? Do you need to make a move? Are you worried about the comfort of your dog? A camping weekend with
        equipment for five people? Enough storage to charge guitars and amps?
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps the biggest hurdle to overcome is the aesthetic one, as the elongated rooflines and rear cargo space
        create an optical effect that is much longer than they are—usually just a few inches longer than their sedan
        counterparts. —, however, this greater distance makes driving more stable and comfortable. In addition, many
        models have a high-performance option that is worth driving.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overcome this, the truth is that family cars are one of the smartest options if you want versatile and
        comfortable transport. For this reason, at JIMA we have compiled a list of models of different sizes that you
        can find on our portal for less than 15,000 euros, which also have their own review on our page.

      <h3 class="secondTitle lineNews">Volkswagen Golf</h3>

      <p>
        The Seat León does not need an introduction in Spain, and it needs it less and less in the rest of the world –
        Germany has already surpassed its native country in sales volume. The current version, launched in 2020, has
        many different types of engines, from plug-in hybrid to natural gas, not forgetting, of course, internal
        combustion. It even has sportier versions, called FR, which are the ones we recommend.
      </p>

      <p>
        Well equipped as standard, Seat models have made a qualitative leap in finishes and materials, so passengers
        will always feel comfortable in it. In addition, one of the strengths of the Spanish brand is the value
        proposition, especially when compared to the Volkswagens with which it shares components and a platform.
      </p>

      </h3>

      <p>
        The Golf is the yardstick by which any car in its segment is judged and, in many cases, those of others. Its
        versatility, its multiple engine options and its well-finished interior have made it become, almost de facto,
        the default purchase option in Europe, although its success is global.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its driving is precise and it has a level of isolation that makes trips comfortable and silent. It has 611
        liters of trunk and engines to satisfy any buyer: 110, 130 and 150 hp gasoline (some of them with light
        hybridization); 115 and 150 hp diesel and even plug-in hybrids. In addition, from Volkswagen they have
        contemplated different classes of buyer and have created versions more designed for dirt roads (Alltrack) or a
        high-performance model, called R, with 320 horses. These last two have a 4Motion all-wheel drive system.
      </p>

      <h3 class="secondTitle lineNews">Kia Creed Tourer</h3>

      <div class="imageNews1">

      <p>
        Value-for-money. That is the basic premise of Kia, and the one that has catapulted it to the top 10 sales in
        Spain since the brand was practically unknown in the market. His Ceed is the answer to the C segment, possibly
        the most competitive in Europe, where the VW Golf reigns with an iron fist. To gain a foothold, Kia has opted
        for generous standard equipment and a seven-year warranty.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the family renewed in 2019, the finishes and technology were updated – and more versions were created, also
        familiar ones such as the Proceed shooting brake or the Xceed crossover – and it was given a 695-liter capacity
        trunk, the leader in the category. Its engines are correct, and it has a 136 hp diesel or a 120 or 140 hp
        gasoline, as well as a plug-in hybrid version.
